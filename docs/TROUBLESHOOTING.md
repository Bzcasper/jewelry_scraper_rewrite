1. Blocked Requests
Symptoms
Scraping jobs fail with HTTP 403 or 429 status codes.
Incomplete data retrieval.
Solutions
Rotate Proxies: Ensure the proxy list (config/proxies.txt) is up-to-date and contains reliable proxies.

python
Copy code
# Implement in your spider
def handle_blocked_request(self, response):
    if response.status == 403:
        self.rotate_proxy()
        return self.retry_request(response.request)
Increase Delays: Adjust the DOWNLOAD_DELAY in the .env file to reduce request frequency.

env
Copy code
DOWNLOAD_DELAY=5
User-Agent Spoofing: Update the User-Agent headers to mimic different browsers.

python
Copy code
# scraper/spiders/base.py
custom_settings = {
    'USER_AGENT': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)...'
}
Respect Robots.txt: Ensure ROBOTSTXT_OBEY is set appropriately in Scrapy settings.

2. Image Download Failures
Symptoms
Missing product images.
Errors related to image URLs.
Solutions
Verify URLs: Ensure image URLs are correct and accessible.

python
Copy code
# scraper/utils/image_processor.py
async def download_image(url):
    try:
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            async with session.get(url) as response:
                if response.status == 200:
                    return await response.read()
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error downloading image: {e}")
        return None
Check Storage Permissions: Ensure the application has write permissions to the IMAGE_STORAGE_PATH.

bash
Copy code
chmod -R 755 data/images
Monitor Bandwidth Usage: High bandwidth usage can lead to download interruptions. Monitor and optimize as needed.

Implement Retry Logic: Add retry mechanisms for failed downloads.

python
Copy code
async def download_with_retry(url, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return await download_image(url)
        except Exception:
            await asyncio.sleep(2 ** attempt)
    logging.error(f"Failed to download image after {max_retries} attempts: {url}")
    return None
3. Database Issues
Symptoms
Unable to connect to the database.
Data not being saved or retrieved correctly.
Corrupted database files.
Solutions
Check Database URL: Ensure the DATABASE_URL in the .env file is correct.

env
Copy code
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///jewelry_scraper.db
Verify Database Server: If using PostgreSQL, ensure the server is running and accessible.

bash
Copy code
sudo service postgresql status
Check Permissions: Ensure the application has the necessary permissions to read/write to the database.

bash
Copy code
chmod 600 jewelry_scraper.db
Backup and Restore: If the database is corrupted, restore from the latest backup in data/backups/.

bash
Copy code
cp data/backups/latest_backup.db jewelry_scraper.db
Run Migrations: Apply any pending database migrations.

bash
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
4. Memory Usage Problems
Symptoms
High memory consumption leading to slow performance.
Application crashes due to insufficient memory.
Solutions
Adjust Batch Sizes: Reduce the number of items processed in each batch.

python
Copy code
# scraper/orchestrator.py
BATCH_SIZE = 20
Optimize Data Storage: Implement data streaming or incremental processing to manage memory usage.

Monitor Resource Usage: Use monitoring tools to track memory usage and identify memory leaks.

bash
Copy code
top
htop
Clean Up Temporary Files: Ensure temporary files are deleted after processing.

python
Copy code
import os

def cleanup_temp_files():
    temp_dir = '/path/to/temp'
    for file in os.listdir(temp_dir):
        os.remove(os.path.join(temp_dir, file))
5. Application Crashes
Symptoms
Unexpected shutdowns of backend or frontend services.
Error messages without clear context.
Solutions
Check Logs: Review log files in the logs/ directory for error details.

bash
Copy code
tail -f backend/logs/app.log
Ensure Dependencies are Installed: Verify that all required packages are installed.

bash
Copy code
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
npm install
Update Dependencies: Sometimes, outdated packages can cause crashes. Update them accordingly.

bash
Copy code
pip install --upgrade -r backend/requirements.txt
npm update
Handle Exceptions: Ensure that all potential exceptions are properly handled in the code to prevent crashes.

python
Copy code
try:
    # risky operation
except SpecificException as e:
    logging.error(f"An error occurred: {e}")
6. Frontend Issues
Symptoms
UI components not rendering correctly.
API calls failing from the frontend.
JavaScript errors in the browser console.
Solutions
Check Console for Errors: Open the browser's developer console to identify JavaScript errors.

Verify API Endpoints: Ensure that the frontend is correctly pointing to the backend API.

javascript
Copy code
// frontend/src/services/api.js
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'http://localhost:5000';
Rebuild Frontend: Sometimes, rebuilding the frontend can resolve rendering issues.

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm run build
Clear Cache: Clear the browser cache to eliminate caching-related issues.

7. Logging and Monitoring
Accessing Logs
Backend Logs: Located in backend/logs/app.log.

bash
Copy code
tail -f backend/logs/app.log
Frontend Logs: Check the browser's developer console for frontend-related logs.

Monitoring Tools
Prometheus & Grafana: Access monitoring dashboards at http://localhost:9090 and http://localhost:3001.

Real-time Monitoring: Use tools like htop, top, or glances to monitor system resources.
